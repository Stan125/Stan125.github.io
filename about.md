### About Me
Hi! I'm Stani, an M.Sc. Applied Statistics student at the University of Göttingen in my final year. I love the statistical programming language R and it's numerous extensions (shiny, markdown). In the field of statistics, I am interested in regression models, most notably GLM's, GAM's and econometric/time series models. Another passion of mine is teaching: I frequently give R and statistics tutorials during the semester.

Because statistics can be head-aching at times, I play Lacrosse and like to travel a lot. I speak german, english y un poco de español. 

If you want to get in touch with me, write me an e-mail. I am always open for some cool projects!
